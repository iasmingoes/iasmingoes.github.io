I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Colorado State University](https://polisci.colostate.edu/). I study the political economy of the Global South, with a focus on Latin America. Much of my research examines how commodity exporters manage their finances and how they work with international organizations to improve natural resource governance. Other topics of interest include sovereign debt, statistical capacity, energy transitions, and economic development broadly defined.

Between 2020 and 2022, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the [Carlos III - Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/en) in Madrid. Before that, I received a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), in addition to degrees in Political Science and Latin American Studies from [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html). I was born in Brazil and named Iasmin (rather than the more traditional variant Yasmin) because Y was not a letter of the [Portuguese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_orthography) at the time. I like spicy food, sourdough bread, vinyasa yoga, road bikes, swimming, and running. I also read a lot of fiction; you can check out what I am currently reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/iasmingoes).
