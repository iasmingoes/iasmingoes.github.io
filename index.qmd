I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Colorado State University](https://polisci.colostate.edu/). I study how governments in the Global South navigate global economic pressures, with a focus on Latin America. My work asks how commodity prices, capital markets, and international organizations shape domestic politics: how states design fiscal policy, attract foreign investment, produce reliable statistics, elect local representatives, and respond to climate change.

Between 2020 and 2022, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the [Carlos III -- Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/en) in Madrid. I hold a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), in addition to degrees in Political Science and Latin American Studies from [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html). I was born in Brazil and named Iasmin (rather than the more traditional Yasmin) because Y was not a letter of the [Portuguese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_orthography) at the time. I like spicy food, yoga, bikes, swimming, running, and reading fiction ([here's](https://www.goodreads.com/iasmingoes) my reading list).
