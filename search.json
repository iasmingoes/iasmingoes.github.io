    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Colorado State University. I study how governments in the Global South navigate global economic pressures, with a focus on Latin America. My work asks how commodity prices, capital markets, and international organizations shape domestic politics: how states design fiscal policy, attract foreign investment, produce reliable statistics, elect local representatives, and respond to climate change.\nBetween 2020 and 2022, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the Carlos III – Juan March Institute in Madrid. I hold a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, in addition to degrees in Political Science and Latin American Studies from Freie Universität Berlin. I was born in Brazil and named Iasmin (rather than the more traditional Yasmin) because Y was not a letter of the Portuguese alphabet at the time. I like spicy food, yoga, bikes, swimming, running, and reading fiction (here’s my reading list)."
