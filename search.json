    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Colorado State University. I study the political economy of natural resources, with a focus on how international organizations promote natural resource governance in the Global South. Other topics of interest include sovereign debt, statistical capacity, energy transitions, and economic development broadly defined.\nBetween 2020 and 2022, I was a Junior Research Fellow at the Carlos III - Juan March Institute in Madrid. Before that, I received a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, in addition to degrees in Political Science and Latin American Studies from Freie Universität Berlin. I was born in Brazil and named Iasmin (rather than the more traditional variant Yasmin) because Y was not a letter of the Portuguese alphabet at the time. In my free time, I like to swim, bike, run, cook, and read fiction; you can check out what I am currently reading here."
